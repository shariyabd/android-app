       <p>C++ is an object-oriented programming language that extends the capabilities of C. It offers additional features like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it suitable for complex software development. C++ is used in game development, system software, and performance-critical applications. Its combination of high-level abstractions and low-level control provides developers with a powerful toolset for building robust and efficient software solutions.</p>

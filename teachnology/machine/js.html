        <p>JavaScript, a widely used programming language for web development, is also making strides in machine learning. With libraries like TensorFlow.js and Brain.js, developers can train and deploy ML models directly in the browser. JavaScript's versatility allows for interactive and real-time ML applications, opening up new possibilities for user engagement and data analysis. While it may not offer the same level of performance as Python, JavaScript's ubiquity and seamless integration with web technologies make it a convenient choice for web-based machine learning projects and democratizing access to ML capabilities.</p>

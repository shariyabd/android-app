        <p>C++, a high-performance programming language, plays a vital role in machine learning applications that demand computational efficiency. With libraries such as Eigen and dlib, C++ offers robust tools for numerical computations and efficient data processing. Its low-level control and memory management allow developers to optimize algorithms for high-performance computing. C++'s speed and scalability make it an excellent choice for large-scale ML projects and resource-constrained environments. While Python remains popular for ML, C++ complements it by providing performance-critical components and enabling seamless integration with existing C++ codebases.</p>
